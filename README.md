# Faster_R_CNN
In this project, Faster R-CNN is employed as a robust two-stage object detection framework to accurately localize and classify target objects within the proposed dataset. Owing to its strong performance in scenarios requiring high localization precision, Faster R-CNN is particularly suitable for datasets that exhibit complex backgrounds, small.
